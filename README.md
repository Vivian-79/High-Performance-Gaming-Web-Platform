# High Performance Gaming Web Platform
## Description
A scalable, high-performance game store platform supporting browsing, search, downloads, and purchases for a large online user base, capable of handling over 3000 TPS with Redis- and Memcached-backed caching and MySQL sharding for elastic scalability.

## ‚ú® Features

Our platform is engineered for high-performance, stability, and security, built upon a microservice architecture.

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Assurance

* **Stateless Authentication:** We use **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for all user authentication and access control, supporting seamless stateless authorization across distributed services.
* **Encrypted Data:** Sensitive operations are secured through enforced authorization and encrypted transport to safeguard user data and ensure industry compliance.
* **Password Hashing:** Passwords are securely hashed using advanced algorithms like **bcrypt** and **PBKDF2**.

### ‚ö° Performance Optimization

* **High Throughput:** The system is stress-tested with **JMeter** and is proven to handle over **3000+ TPS** (Transactions Per Second).
* **Multi-Tier Caching:** Critical "hot data" is cached using **Redis** and **Memcached** to significantly reduce database load and cut query latency from $200ms$ to under $40ms$.
* **Asynchronous Messaging:** **Kafka** is tuned (partitions, replicas, batch size, linger time) to absorb burst traffic, ensuring reliable and efficient asynchronous message processing.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è High Availability & Scalability

* **Distributed Architecture:** The database layer employs strategies like **MySQL Sharding** and **Partitioning (RANGE, LIST, HASH)** to distribute user and transaction data across multiple nodes, ensuring elastic scalability and preventing bottlenecks.
* **Load Balancing:** Traffic is efficiently distributed using high-availability load balancers like **Nginx** and **HAProxy** (or cloud solutions like **AWS ELB**).
* **Data Redundancy:** Critical services utilize master-slave replication models (e.g., **Redis Master/Slave**) for continuous data availability.
